How It Works:
On page load, the app attempts to detect your location using the Geolocation API.

If successful, it fetches and displays the current weather.

Users can also enter a city manually to search for weather data.

Background images animate every 4 seconds to create a slideshow effect.

Weather info updates with animated transitions.

Customization Tips:
Replace or add new images in the .background-slide classes to change the slideshow.

Modify or extend the weatherIcons object in script.js to support more weather types.

Enhance with additional features like hourly forecasts, air quality, or unit toggles (°C/°F)

Known Issues:
Geolocation might not work in some browsers without HTTPS.

Weather icon may show a default cloud if the weather condition is not mapped.

To-Do:
 Add error handling for API limit exceeded

 Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit

 Add weather forecast for the next few days
